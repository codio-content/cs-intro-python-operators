problem solving:
:   The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing it.

high-level language:
:   A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

low-level language:
:   A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to run; also called “machine language” or “assembly language”.

portability:
:   A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

interpreter:
:   A program that reads another program and executes it

prompt:
:   Characters displayed by the interpreter to indicate that it is ready to take input from the user.

program:
:   A set of instructions that specifies a computation.

print statement:

operator:
:   A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

value:
:   One of the basic units of data, like a number or string, that a program manipulates.

type:
:   A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type <span>int</span>), floating-point numbers (type <span>float</span>), and strings (type <span>str</span>).

integer:
:   A type that represents whole numbers.

floating-point:
:   A type that represents numbers with fractional parts.

string:
:   A type that represents sequences of characters.

natural language:
:   Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

formal language:
:   Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.

token:
:   One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.

syntax:
:   The rules that govern the structure of a program.

parse:
:   To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

bug:
:   An error in a program.

debugging:
:   The process of finding and correcting bugs.
