## Changing a List
Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and will print a list with the elements `odd` or `even` based on the elements of `numbers`. For example, if `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then your program will print `['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']`.

**Important**, do not edit the code in the top section. This code is necessary for the auto-grader to work. Add your code in the section below. Clicking the `TRY IT` button will test your code with `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
