## The `or` Operator

The `and` operator allows for compound (more than one) boolean expressions. If only one boolean expressions is true, then the whole thing is true. To be false, all boolean expressions **must** be false.

```python
a = True
b = True
c = False
d = False
print(a or b)
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `print` to `print(a or c)`?
* Change `print` to `print(c or d)`?

## Multiple `or` Statements

You can chain several `or` statements together. They are evaluated in a left-to-right manner.

```python
a = True
b = True
c = False
print(a or b or c)
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `print` to `print(a or c or c or c or c)`?
* Change `print` to `print(c and c and c and c and c)`?
