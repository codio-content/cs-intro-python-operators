## Lab 2

This lab uses a comma delimited CSV file `files-lab2.csv`, which contains integers. There are three columns and four rows. The program below will print the sum for each row in the CSV.

Start by importing the `os` module and the `csv` module. Create the variable `path` with the string `.guides/secure`.

```python
import os
import csv

path = ".guides/secure"
```
Open the CSV file in read mode, and pass the file to a `csv.reader`.

```python
with open(os.path.join(path, "files-lab2.csv"), "r") as input_file:
    reader = csv.reader(input_file)
```

Next, add a nested loop. The outer loop relates to the rows of the CSV file, while the inner loop will go through the numbers in each row. Declare the variable `total` after the first loop, but before the second loop. Set `total` to 0.

```python
    for row in reader:
        total = 0
        for num in row:
```

Add each number in the row to the variable `total`. Values in CSV files are stored as strings, so typecast `num` as an integer so you can perform addition.

```python
        for num in row:
            total += int(num)
```

After the inner loop has finished running, print the value of `total` with a short explanation.

```python
        for num in row:
            total += int(num)
        print("The total value is: {}".format(total))
```

Run the program. You should see the following output:

```text
The total value is: 10
The total value is: 151
The total value is: 63
The total value is: 127
```
