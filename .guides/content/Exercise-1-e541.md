## Strings Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a problem that takes input from a user and prints the first character of the input and the last character with some context. **Important**, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use `input()`. Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.

**Expected Output**
* If `baseball` then you will print `b is the first chracter and l is the last character`
* If `cat` then you will print `c is the first character and t is the last character`
