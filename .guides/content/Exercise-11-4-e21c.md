If you did Exercise 10.7, you already have a function named `has_duplicates` that takes a list as a parameter and returns <span>True</span> if there is any object that appears more than once in the list.

Use a dictionary to write a faster, simpler version of `has_duplicates`. Solution: <http://thinkpython2.com/code/has_duplicates.py>.
