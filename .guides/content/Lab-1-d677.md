## Counting Uppercase and Lowercase Characters

You are going to write a program that takes a string and prints out two messages. One message tells you how many uppercase characters are in the string. The other messages says how many lowercase characters are in the string. The program will ignore all numbers and special characters (punctuation, symbols, etc.).

### String Methods

You will need two string methods that were not covered earlier to help with this project:
* `.isupper()` - Returns `True` if the character is uppercase, `False` if the character is lowercase
* `.islower()` - Returns `True` if the character is lowercase, `False` if the character is uppercase

### Variables
You will need three variables for this project. One variable will count all of the lowercase variables, another to count the uppercase variables, and a string variable.

```python
lower_count = 0
upper_count = 0
my_string = "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue"
```

### Iterating Over the String
The next thing to do is iterate over the string. A simple for loop works best.

```python
for char in my_string:
```

### Checking for Uppercase and Lowercase
It does not matter if you check for an uppercase character first or check for a lowercase character. Let's start with lowercase characters. Ask if the character is lowercase and increment the appropriate counting variable.

```python
for char in my_string:
    if char.islower():
        lower_count += 1
```

What you **do not** want to do is use an `else` statement. This will not give you an accurate count. Asking if a special character is lowercase will return `False`. However, that does not mean they uppercase characters. Special characters are neither uppercase or lowercase. So use an `elif` and ask if the character is uppercase. If so, increment the uppercase counting variable.

```python
    elif char.isupper():
        upper_count += 1
```

### Print the Results
The final step is to print the messages with the count values. We are going to use the `format` method for string interpolation.

```python
print("There are {} lowercase characters.".format(lower_count))
print("There are {} uppercase characters.".format(upper_count))
```

There should be 4 uppercase characters and 21 lowercase characters.
