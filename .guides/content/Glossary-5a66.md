--------

object-oriented language:
:   A language that provides features, such as programmer-defined types and methods, that facilitate object-oriented programming.

object-oriented programming:
:   A style of programming in which data and the operations that manipulate it are organized into classes and methods.

method:
:   A function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on instances of that class.

subject:
:   The object a method is invoked on.

positional argument:
:   An argument that does not include a parameter name, so it is not a keyword argument.

operator overloading:
:   Changing the behavior of an operator like <span>+</span> so it works with a programmer-defined type.

type-based dispatch:
:   A programming pattern that checks the type of an operand and invokes different functions for different types.

polymorphic:
:   Pertaining to a function that can work with more than one type.

information hiding:
:   The principle that the interface provided by an object should not depend on its implementation, in particular the representation of its attributes.
