## Adding Helper Functions

On the previous page, the following functions were referenced in the program, but have not yet been declared. Create the functions before the `user_interface` function. Set the function bodies to `pass` for now.

```python
def ask_column():
    """Ask the user by which criteria they want to sort the data"""
    pass
      
def sanitize_column(column):
    """Return True if the user entered a valid number, else return False"""
    pass
    
def ask_order():
    """Ask the user how they want the data sorted: ascending or descending"""
    pass

def sanitize_order(order):
    """Return True if the user entered a valid number, else return False"""
    pass
```

The code should be working now. However, because none of the above functions do anything, there will be no output. Run your program to make sure that there are no errors before continuing.

The function `ask_column` should ask the user to type in a number 1 to 6, with each number representing a choice. To make this readable, each choice should be on its own line. This is where the triple-quote makes printed formatted text easy. The function should return the value `column`.

```python
def ask_column():
    """Ask the user by which criteria they want to sort the data"""
    column = input("""How do you want to sort the movie data? Enter the number Enter '6' to exit the program.
        1) By Film Title
        2) By Genre
        3) By Rotten Tomatoes Score
        4) By Worldwide Gross
        5) By Year
        6) Quit\n""")
    return column
```

The function `sanitize_column` returns `True` if the user typed in a valid choice. It returns `False` if they did not. Two things must be true for `column` to be a valid choice. First, it must be a number. Any data coming from `input` is captured as a string. The string `"6"` can be typecast as an int; the string `"cat"` cannot. If `column` cannot be typecast as an int, then there is a `ValueError`. So this function is going to use `try... except`. A `ValueError` should result in the function returning `False`. The second thing that must be true is that `column` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 6. Return the value of this boolean expression.

```python
def sanitize_column(column):
    """Return True if the user entered a valid number, else return False"""
    try:
        int(column)
        return int(column) >= 1 and int(column) <= 5
    except ValueError:
        return False
```

The `ask_order` function is almost identical to the `ask_column` function. Instead, it asks the user to enter a 1 or 2.

```python
def ask_order():
    """Ask the user how they want the data sorted: ascending or descending"""
    order = input("""How do you want the movie data ordered?
            1) Ascending Order
            2) Descending Order\n""")
    return order
```

Similarly, `santize_order` is almost identical to `sanitize_column`. Instead, it checks to see if `order` is either a 1 or 2.

```python
def sanitize_order(order):
    """Return True if the user entered a valid number, else return False"""
    try:
        int(order)
        return int(order) >= 1 and int(order) <= 2
    except ValueError:
        return False
```
