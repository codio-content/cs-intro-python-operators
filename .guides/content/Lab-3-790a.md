## Lab 3

The following program will ask the user to enter the name of a superhero and then to enter their superpower. These two pieces of information will be written to the CSV file called `superheroes.csv`. When the user enters `stop` for the superhero name, the program will stop running.

Start by importing the `os` and `csv` modules. The CSV file will be exported to the `students_folder/csv` folder, so use that as the value for the variable `path`.

```python
import os
import csv

path = "student_folder/csv"
```

Open the `superheroes.csv` file in write mode as `output_file` and setup a `csv.writer`. The first row in the CSV file should be headers for each column of data.

```python
with open(os.path.join(path, "superheroes.csv"), "w") as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    writer.writerow(["Superhero", "Power"])
```

Now is the time to ask the user to input the name of the superhero and their superpower. You should also tell the user how to quit the program.

```python
    print("Enter `stop` to quit the program")
    name = input("Enter the superhero's name: ")
    power = input("Enter their superpower: ")
```

The program should run again and again until the user enters `stop`. Since the for loop runs for a predetermined amount of time, an infinite while loop is a better choice. The stop condition is when `name` is equal to `stop`.

```python
    while True:
```

Now, write a line to the CSV file with `name` and `power`. Then ask the user to enter another superhero name. Be sure to check and if it is equal to `"stop"`. Exit the loop with a `break` statement. Finally, ask the user to enter the superpower.

```python
        writer.writerow([name, power])
        name = input("Enter the superhero's name: ")
        if name == "stop":
            break
        power = input("Enter their superpower: ")
```

Run the program and enter some information. Click the link below to view the CSV file.
