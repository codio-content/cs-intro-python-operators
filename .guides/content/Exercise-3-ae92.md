## Functions Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a function called `search_list` that takes a list and a search term as parameters. If the search term is located in the list, return the index of the matching element. The function should work even if there is a difference in capitalization. If the search term is not in the list, return `-1`.

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `search_list(["dog", "fish", "cat"], "Cat")`, the the function would return `2`
* If the function call is `search_list(["dog", "fish", "cat"], "mouse")`, the the function would return `-1`
