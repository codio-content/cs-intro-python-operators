## Lab 2 - The Hilbert Curve

![Hilbert Curve](.guides/images/hilbert_curve.png)

The [Hilbert Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) is a fractal, space-filling curve. Start by importing the turtle module, create a turtle object, and write the function header for the recursive function `hilbert`. The parameters for the function are the distance the turtle will travel, the rule to be used, an angle (determines how tight the fractal is), depth (how intricate the fractal is), and the turtle object. Use `pass` for the body for now.

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

def hilbert(dist, rule, angle, depth, t):
    """Draw a Hilber Curve"""
    pass
```

The base case for the function is when `depth` is 0. Another way to think about the base case is that if `depth` is greater than 0, keep drawing the fractal. Use `if depth > 0:` as the base case. Also, there are two rules for the turtle. Ask if `rule` is equal to 1 or if it is equal to 2. Use `pass` for the body of these conditionals.

```python
def hilbert(dist, rule, angle, depth, t):
    """Draw a Hilber Curve"""
    if depth > 0:
    
        if rule == 1:
            pass
      
        if rule == 2:
            pass
```

If `rule` is equal to 1, then the turtle is going to turn left, recursively call the `hilbert` function with `rule` set to 2, go forward, turn right, recursively call the `hilbert` function with `rule` set to 1, go forward, recursively call the `hilbert` function with `rule` set to 1, turn right, and finally move forward. Because the base case is based on `depth`, it must be reduced by 1 each time the `hilbert` function is called recursively.

```python
        if rule == 1:
            t.left(angle)
            hilbert(dist, 2, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.forward(dist)
            t.right(angle)
            hilbert(dist, 1, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.forward(dist)
            hilbert(dist, 1, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.right(angle)
            t.forward(dist)
            hilbert(dist, 2, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.left(angle)
```

If `rule` is equal to 2, then the code is almost the inverse of when `rule` is equal to 1. The turtle will still go forward, but left turns become right turns, right turns become left turns, and recursive calls to `hilbert` will use 2 instead of 1 for the `rule` parameter (and vice versa).

```python
        if rule == 2:
            t.right(angle)
            hilbert(dist, 1, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.forward(dist)
            t.left(angle)
            hilbert(dist, 2, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.forward(dist)
            hilbert(dist, 2, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.left(angle)
            t.forward(dist)
            hilbert(dist, 1, angle, depth - 1, t)
            t.right(angle)
```

Finally, call the `hilbert` function and run the program to see the fractal.

```python
hilbert(5, 1, 90, 5, t)
```

## What happens if you:
* Change the `dist` parameter?
* Start with the `rule` parameter as 2?
* Increase or decrease the `angle` parameter?
* Increase or  decrease the `depth` parameter?
