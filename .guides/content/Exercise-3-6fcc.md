## Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a program that accepts input from the user. Create another string that contains either a `u`, `l`, or `-` for each character of the original string. Use `u` when the character is uppercase, and use `l` when the character is lowercase. If the character is neither uppercase or lowercase, use `-`. Print the second string. **Important**, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use `input()`. Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.

**Expected Output**
* If the user inputs `cat`, then the output will be:
```python
cat
lll
```
* If the user inputs `HouSE`, then the output will be:
```python
HouSE
ulluu
```
