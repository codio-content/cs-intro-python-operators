## Swapping the Case of Characters
You are going to write a program that takes a string and prints a new string where all of the uppercase letters become lowercase, and the lowercase letters become uppercase.

### Variables
You are going to need two string variables. The first one represents the original string, and the second variable represents the modified string. The modified string can be an empty string.

```python
original_string = "THE BROWN DOG JUMPS over the lazy fox"
modified_string = ""
```

### String Iteration
It does not matter if you start at the beginning of the string or the end for iteration. A simple for loop is the easiest way to iterate through the `original_string`.

```python
for char in original_string:
```

### String Methods
You are going to use the `isupper` and `islower` methods to test if a character is uppercase or lowercase. In addition, you will be using the `upper` and `lower` methods to convert characters to its new case.

### Conditional
We will test if a character is lowercase. It does not matter if you decide to test for uppercase, just be sure to make the appropriate conversion.

```python
    if char.islower():
```

If this is true, then append the uppercase version of the character to the variable `modified_string`.

```python
        modified_string += char.upper()
```

If the conditional is false, then append the lowercase version of the character to `modified_string`.

```python
    else:
        modified_string += char.lower()
````

You do not need to worry about special characters. Converting them to uppercase or lowercase has no effect.

### Printing the Results
Once the loop has finished, print both the original string and the modified string. Use the `format` method to add some context to the output.

```python
print("The original string is: {}".format(original_string))
print("The modified string is: {}".format(modified_string))
```

You should see the following output:

The original string is: THE BROWN DOG JUMPS over the lazy fox
The modified string is: the brown dog jumps OVER THE LAZY FOX
