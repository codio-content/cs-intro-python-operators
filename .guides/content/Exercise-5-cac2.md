## Functions Exercise 5

**Problem**
Write a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as a parameter. The function will return `True` if the string is a palindrome (is the same forward and backward). The function will return `False` if the string is not a palindrome.

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `is_palindrome("level")`, the the function would return `True`
* If the function call is `is_palindrome("house")`, the the function would return `False`

**Important**
**Do not** use a helper function for this problem. Though this is good situation in which to use one, the auto-grader only works if all of the coding is done inside the `is_palindrome` function.
