## Recursion Exercise 2

**Problem**
Write a recursive function called `list_sum` that takes a list of numbers as a parameter. Return the sum of all of the numbers in the list.

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `list_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, then the function would return `15`
* If the function call is `list_sum([10, 12.5, 10, 7])`, then the function would return `39.5`
