## Lists Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `strings` that contains a random selection of strings. Your program should print the first string when arranged in alphabetical order. 

**Expected Output**
* If `strings = ['luck', 'cat', 'kid', 'house']` then you will print `cat`
* If `strings = ['duck', 'dddd', 'mouse', 'kite']` then you will print `dddd`

**Important**
Do not edit the code in the top section. This code is necessary for the auto-grader to work. Add your code in the section below. Clicking the `TEST 1` button will test your code with `strings = ['luck', 'cat', 'kid', 'house']`. `TEST 2` will test your code with `strings = ['duck', 'dddd', 'mouse', 'kite']`.
