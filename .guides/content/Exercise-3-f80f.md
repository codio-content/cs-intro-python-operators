## Recursion Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a recursive function called `bunny_ears` that takes the number of bunnies (an integer) as a parameter. Return the number of bunny ears (2 per bunny). Do not use multiplication.

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `bunny_ears(8)`, then the function would return `16`
* If the function call is `bunny_ears(0)`, then the function would return `0`
