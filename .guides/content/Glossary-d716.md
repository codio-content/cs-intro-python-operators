encode:
:   To represent one set of values using another set of values by constructing a mapping between them.

class attribute:
:   An attribute associated with a class object. Class attributes are defined inside a class definition but outside any method.

instance attribute:
:   An attribute associated with an instance of a class.

veneer:
:   A method or function that provides a different interface to another function without doing much computation.

inheritance:
:   The ability to define a new class that is a modified version of a previously defined class.

parent class:
:   The class from which a child class inherits.

child class:
:   A new class created by inheriting from an existing class; also called a “subclass”.

IS-A relationship:
:   A relationship between a child class and its parent class.

HAS-A relationship:
:   A relationship between two classes where instances of one class contain references to instances of the other.

dependency:
:   A relationship between two classes where instances of one class use instances of the other class, but do not store them as attributes.

class diagram:
:   A diagram that shows the classes in a program and the relationships between them.

multiplicity:
:   A notation in a class diagram that shows, for a HAS-A relationship, how many references there are to instances of another class.

data encapsulation:
:   A program development plan that involves a prototype using global variables and a final version that makes the global variables into instance attributes.
