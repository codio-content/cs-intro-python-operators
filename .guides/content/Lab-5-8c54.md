----------
## Replacing Vowels with a *
You are going to write a program that takes a string called `my_string` and returns the string but with a `*` in the place of vowels. Assume that vowels are `a, e, i, o, u`. For example, if `my_string = "Hello"`, then your program will print `"H*ll*"`.

**Important**, the variable `my_string` is already declared as an empty string. Add a value to it and test your code. However, **do not** submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
