analysis of algorithms: 
:    A way to compare algorithms in terms of their run time and/or space requirements.

machine model: 
:    A simplified representation of a computer used to describe algorithms.

worst case:
:    The input that makes a given algorithm run slowest (or require the most space.

leading term:
:    In a polynomial, the term with the highest exponent.

crossover point:
:    The problem size where two algorithms require the same run time or space.

order of growth:
:    A set of functions that all grow in a way considered equivalent for purposes of analysis of algorithms. For example, all functions that grow linearly belong to the same order of growth.

Big-Oh notation:
:    Notation for representing an order of growth; for example, $O(n)$ represents the set of functions that grow linearly.

linear:
:    An algorithm whose run time is proportional to problem size, at least for large problem sizes.

quadratic:
:    An algorithm whose run time is proportional to $n^2$, where n is a measure of problem size.

search:
:    The problem of locating an element of a collection (like a list or dictionary) or determining that it is not present.

hashtable: 
:    A data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs and performs search in constant time.
